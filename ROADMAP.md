## Overview

This roadmap outlines the development priorities for rust-expect, organized by milestone.
Each milestone builds on the previous, with clear exit criteria and deliverables.

### Current Status

The project has completed implementation of all planned features (Milestones 1-4). The library
is feature-complete and ready for initial release. Key achievements:

- Cross-platform PTY support (Unix via rustix, Windows via ConPTY)
- Async-first Session API with pattern matching
- Multi-session management with `expect_any()` and `expect_all()`
- Interactive mode with pattern hooks
- Screen buffer with full VT100 emulation and visual diff (feature-gated)
- Mock backend for testing (feature-gated)
- Complete SSH backend with connection pooling, resilient sessions, and retry policies
- PII detection and redaction with custom patterns
- Prometheus and OpenTelemetry metrics export
- Zero-copy I/O and mmap-backed large buffers
- Comprehensive CI with cross-platform testing

## Competitive Position

### Current Advantages

1. **Async-first design** - Native Tokio integration, no blocking
2. **Type safety** - Strong Rust types, no stringly-typed APIs
3. **Cross-platform** - Single API for Unix and Windows
4. **Modern tooling** - Edition 2024, workspace structure
5. **Complete SSH backend** - Connection pooling, resilient sessions, retry policies
6. **PII protection** - Built-in sensitive data redaction
7. **Observability** - Prometheus and OpenTelemetry integration

### Differentiation from expectrl

| Feature | rust-expect | expectrl |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Async-first | ✅ Native | ⚠️ Added later |
| Windows ConPTY | ✅ Full support | ⚠️ Limited |
| SSH resilience | ✅ Auto-reconnect | ❌ Manual |
| PII redaction | ✅ Built-in | ❌ Not available |
| Screen emulation | ✅ VT100 + visual diff | ⚠️ Basic |
| Metrics | ✅ Prometheus/OTLP | ❌ Not available |
